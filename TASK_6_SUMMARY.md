# Task 6: PDF Export + Sharing - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive PDF report generation with professional HTML formatting and native sharing capabilities using expo-print, expo-file-system, and expo-sharing.

## Files Created

### 1. **`src/utils/pdfExport.ts`** (New)

Complete PDF export utility with TypeScript:

#### Functions Implemented:

**`generatePDFReport(readings: GlucoseReading[]): Promise<boolean>`**
Main export function that:

1. Validates data (checks for readings)
2. Calculates all-time and 14-day statistics
3. Generates weekly insight
4. Creates HTML report
5. Converts HTML to PDF
6. Saves with proper filename
7. Opens native share dialog
8. Updates last export timestamp

**`getLastExportTimestamp(): Promise<number | null>`**

- Retrieves last export date from AsyncStorage
- Returns timestamp or null if never exported

**`generateReportHTML(readings, allTimeStats, stats14Days, weeklyInsight): string`**
Creates professional HTML report with:

- Header with title and generation date
- Weekly insight card
- Overall statistics
- 14-day statistics with percentages
- Recent readings table (last 30)
- Disclaimer
- Footer

**Helper Functions:**

- `setLastExportTimestamp()` - Saves export timestamp
- `formatDate(timestamp)` - Formats dates for display
- `formatFilenameDate()` - Formats date for filename (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `getColorForValue(value)` - Returns color based on glucose level
- `getStatusForValue(value)` - Returns status text (Normal/High/Low)

## Files Modified

### 2. **`src/screens/Settings.tsx`** (Enhanced)

#### New Features Added:

**📄 PDF Export Button**

## Technical Implementation

### PDF Generation Flow:

```typescript
// 1. Get all necessary data
const allTimeStats = await getReadingStats(readings);
const stats14Days = getDetailedStats(readings, 14);
const weeklyInsight = getWeeklyInsight(readings);

// 2. Generate HTML
const html = generateReportHTML(
  readings,
  allTimeStats,
  stats14Days,
  weeklyInsight
);

// 3. Convert to PDF
const { uri } = await Print.printToFileAsync({ html });

// 4. Move to better location with proper filename
const filename = `GlucoMate-Report-${formatFilenameDate()}.pdf`;
const newUri = `${FileSystem.documentDirectory}${filename}`;
await FileSystem.moveAsync({ from: uri, to: newUri });

// 5. Share the PDF
await Sharing.shareAsync(newUri, {
  mimeType: "application/pdf",
  dialogTitle: "Share Your GlucoMate Report",
  UTI: "com.adobe.pdf",
});

// 6. Update timestamp
await setLastExportTimestamp();
```

### File Naming:

- Format: `GlucoMate-Report-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
- Example: `GlucoMate-Report-2024-12-25.pdf`
- Stored in: `FileSystem.documentDirectory`
