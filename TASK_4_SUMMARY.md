## Technical Implementation

### Insights Algorithm
```typescript
// Analyzes readings and generates personalized message
1. Check latest reading for immediate alerts
2. Analyze average for trends
3. Check variability for consistency
4. Look for patterns (fasting, post-meal)
5. Recognize streaks and achievements
6. Provide encouragement
```

### Filter Logic
```typescript
// Efficient filtering with useMemo
1. Copy readings array
2. Apply type filter (if not 'All')
3. Calculate date range thresholds
4. Filter by timestamp
5. Return filtered array
```

### Edit Updates
```typescript
// Preserves ID, updates fields
1. Load existing reading
2. Pre-fill form
3. Validate changes
4. Update specific reading in storage
5. Refresh UI
```

## Code Quality

- ✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- ✅ **No Linter Errors**: Clean code
- ✅ **Memoization**: useMemo for filters
- ✅ **Animations**: Smooth Moti transitions
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Confirmations and alerts
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Clear actions and labels
