# Task 3: Create Add Reading Flow - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Implemented a complete glucose reading management system with form input, data persistence, and display functionality across Dashboard and History screens.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

#### 1. **`src/types/reading.ts`** (New)

TypeScript type definitions for glucose readings:

```typescript
export type ReadingType = "Fasting" | "Post-meal" | "Random";

export interface GlucoseReading {
  id: string;
  type: ReadingType;
  value: number;
  timestamp: number;
  notes?: string;
}
```

**Key Features:**

- Strict type definitions for reading types
- Comprehensive reading interface
- Statistics interface for data analysis

#### 2. **`src/utils/storage.ts`** (New)

Complete storage utility library with AsyncStorage:

- ✅ `getReadings()` - Retrieve all readings, sorted by timestamp
- ✅ `saveReading(value, type, timestamp?, notes?)` - Save new reading with UUID
- ✅ `deleteReading(id)` - Delete reading by ID
- ✅ `updateReading(id, updates)` - Update existing reading
- ✅ `getReadingsByDateRange(start, end)` - Filter by date range
- ✅ `getReadingsByType(type)` - Filter by reading type
- ✅ `getReadingStats(readings?)` - Calculate average, high, low, total
- ✅ `clearAllReadings()` - Clear all data

**Key Features:**

- UUID generation for unique IDs
- Input validation (1-600 mg/dL)
- Error handling with try-catch
- Sorted results (newest first)

- ✅ Visual feedback for selection
- ✅ Type-safe implementation

**Features:**

- 🌅 Fasting: "Before eating (8+ hours)"
- 🍽️ Post-meal: "1-2 hours after eating"
- ⏰ Random: "Any time of day"
- Touch-friendly interface
- Visual indicators for selected type

#### 4. **`src/hooks/useReadings.ts`** (New)

Custom React hook for reading management:

```typescript
export const useReadings = () => {
  readings: GlucoseReading[];
  stats: ReadingStats;
  isLoading: boolean;
  refresh: () => Promise<void>;
  deleteReading: (id: string) => Promise<boolean>;
}
```

**Features:**

- Automatic data loading on mount
