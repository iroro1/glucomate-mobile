# Task 5: Implement Trend Insights - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive trend analysis with rule-based insights and interactive Victory Native charts for visualizing glucose patterns over the last 14 days.

## Files Modified/Enhanced

### 1. **`src/utils/insights.ts`** (Enhanced)

#### New Functions Added:

**`getWeeklyInsight(readings)`**
Generates week-over-week comparison insights with specific rules:

```typescript
// Rule 1: Average increased
if (avg7 > avgPrev7 + 5) 
  return "📈 Your glucose average rose this week (avg7 vs avgPrev7 mg/dL last week)."

// Rule 2: Average decreased (improvement)
if (avg7 < avgPrev7 - 5) 
  return "📉 Great job — readings improved this week! (avg7 vs avgPrev7 mg/dL last week)"

// Rule 3: Multiple high fasting readings
if (fastingHighs >= 3) 
  return "🌅 You've had X high fasting readings recently. Consider reviewing your evening routine."

// Rule 4: Post-meal spikes
if (postMealHighs >= 3)
  return "🍽️ You've had X post-meal spikes this week. Consider portion sizes or meal composition."

// Rule 5: Low readings
if (lows >= 2)
  return "⚠️ You've had X low readings this week. Discuss with your healthcare provider if this continues."

// Rule 6: Consistency recognition
if (currentWeekReadings.length >= 7)
  return "✅ Stable week with X readings. Keep tracking daily!"

// Default
return "➡️ Stable week. Keep tracking daily! (X readings this week)"
```

**Key Features:**
- Compares last 7 days vs previous 7 days
- Detects significant changes (>5 mg/dL difference)
- Identifies patterns (fasting highs, post-meal spikes, lows)
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Recognizes consistent tracking

**`getDetailedStats(readings, days = 14)`**
Calculates comprehensive statistics for a time period:

```typescript
{
  average: number,
  highest: GlucoseReading | null,
  lowest: GlucoseReading | null,
  total: number,
  inRange: number,        // Count of readings 70-140 mg/dL
  highCount: number,      // Count > 140 mg/dL
  lowCount: number,       // Count < 70 mg/dL
  byType: {
    fasting: GlucoseReading[],
    postMeal: GlucoseReading[],
    random: GlucoseReading[],
  }
}
```

**Helper Functions:**
- `calculateAverage(readings)` - Calculates mean glucose value
- `getReadingsInRange(readings, startTime, endTime)` - Filters by timestamp

### 2. **`src/screens/Insights.tsx`** (Complete Rewrite)

#### Features Implemented:

**📈 14-Day Trend Chart (Victory Native)**
- Line chart showing glucose trends over 14 days
- Target range shading (70-140 mg/dL in green)
- Color-coded data points:
  - 🟢 Green: Normal (70-140)
  - 🟠 Orange: Low (<70)
  - 🔴 Red: High (>140)
- Smooth interpolation between points
- Grid lines for easy reading
- X-axis: Day numbers (1-14)
- Y-axis: Glucose values (60-180 mg/dL)

**🧠 Weekly Insight Card**
- Displays personalized weekly insight
- Updates automatically with new data
- Rule-based analysis from `getWeeklyInsight()`

**📊 14-Day Statistics Card**
- Average, Highest, Lowest readings
- Percentage breakdown:
  - % In Range (70-140)
  - % High (>140)
  - % Low (<70)
- Visual color coding

**🔍 Breakdown by Type**
- Separate stats for:
  - 🌅 Fasting readings
  - 🍽️ Post-meal readings
  - ⏰ Random readings
- Count and average for each type
- Color-coded cards

**💡 Tips Card**
- Educational content
- Best practices for glucose control
- Tracking recommendations

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Data Preparation

```typescript
const prepareChartData = () => {
  // Filter last 14 days
  const fourteenDaysAgo = now - (14 * oneDayMs);
  const last14DaysReadings = readings.filter(r => r.timestamp >= fourteenDaysAgo);
  
  // Sort by timestamp
  const sortedReadings = [...last14DaysReadings].sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp);
  
  // Convert to chart format
  return sortedReadings.map((reading) => {
    const daysSinceStart = Math.floor((reading.timestamp - fourteenDaysAgo) / oneDayMs);
    return {
      x: daysSinceStart,    // Day 0-13
      y: reading.value,      // Glucose value
      timestamp: reading.timestamp,
      type: reading.type,
    };
  });
};
```

### Victory Native Chart Configuration

```typescript
<VictoryChart
  width={chartWidth}
  height={250}
  theme={VictoryTheme.material}
  padding={{ top: 20, bottom: 40, left: 50, right: 20 }}
>
  {/* Target range background */}
  <VictoryArea
    data={[...]}
    style={{ data: { fill: '#E8F5E9', fillOpacity: 0.3 } }}
  />

  {/* Grid and axes */}
  <VictoryAxis dependentAxis tickValues={[60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180]} />
  <VictoryAxis tickFormat={(t) => `Day ${t + 1}`} />

  {/* Trend line */}
  <VictoryLine
    data={chartData}
    style={{ data: { stroke: '#4A90E2', strokeWidth: 2 } }}
    interpolation="natural"
  />

  {/* Data points */}
  <VictoryScatter
    data={chartData}
    size={5}
    style={{ data: { fill: ({ datum }) => getColorForValue(datum.y) } }}
  />
</VictoryChart>
```
